# Nagios-Elasticpulse
I got tired of not having the plugins i wanted so i am making a series of Nagios plugins to check the document counts in an Elasticsearch index. It will tell me if a job stops indexing documents in a given timespan...

## Example of a rule i Nagios.
I removed the .sh extension and moved it to the /usr/local/nagios/libexec folder.

I also made it executeable bu Nagios
`chmod +x /usr/local/nagios/libexec/elasticpulse_indexcount`

```bash
define command{
    command_name    check_indexactive
    command_line    $USER1$/elasticpulse_indexcount
}

define service{
        use                     generic-service
        host_name               myelasticserver
        service_description     Test_plugin
        check_command           check_indexactive
}
```
